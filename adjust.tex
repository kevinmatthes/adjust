\section{Installation and Updating}
\label{sec:installation-and-updating}
\subsection{Installation}
\label{sec:installation}
At the moment, the only way to install \adjust\ is from source.  In order to
create a local copy of the public GitHub repository, it is recommended to
execute the command shown in \Vref{lst:download} to clone the entire repository
to \texttt{\textasciitilde/.vmodules/adjust/}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Downloading \adjust, label = lst:download]
v install --git https://github.com/kevinmatthes/adjust
\end{lstlisting}

The second step is the compilation of the executable.  Users should compile the
software using the instruction given in \Vref{lst:compilation} in order to
achieve an enhanced performance (flag \texttt{-prod}).  The flag \texttt{-W}
will make sure that the source code does not contain any errors.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Compiling \adjust, label = lst:compilation]
v -W -prod ~/.vmodules/adjust/
\end{lstlisting}

For convenience, the resulting binary may be linked to \texttt{\$PATH}, at
option.  Unix users might therefore consider the command stated in \Vref
{lst:softlink} useful.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Softlinking \adjust, label = lst:softlink]
ln -s ~/.vmodules/adjust/adjust ~/.local/bin/adjust
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Self-Updating}
\label{sec:self-updating}
\adjust\ has a built-in self-updating mechanism which is defined as a wrapper
around \Vref{lst:download} and \Vref{lst:compilation}.  It is invoked as
illustrated by \Vref{lst:update}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Updating \adjust, label = lst:update]
adjust --nightly
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Editor Modes}
\label{sec:editor-modes}
\subsection{Command Mode}
\label{sec:command-mode}
The \texttt{command} mode of \adjust\ is designed to instruct the editor in a
terminal-like manner.

If the current editor mode is \texttt{view}, the \texttt{command} mode can be
entered by typing \texttt{:}.  Any succeeding text input will be added to the
command buffer whilst the backspace key will remove the last character from it.
The current content of the command buffer is shown in the second line of the
status bar.  When pressing the enter key, the specified command will be executed
which usually involves resetting the command buffer.  Unknown commands will not
have any effect.

The supported commands are explained in the following by their category.

\subsubsection{Changing to \texttt{insert} Mode}
\label{sec:changing-to-insert-mode}
To enter the \texttt{insert} mode from the \texttt{command} mode, users might
consider the following commands useful in addition to entering the target mode
by changing to \texttt{view} mode intermediately.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{:edit}
\item \texttt{:insert}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Changing to \texttt{view} Mode}
\label{sec:changing-to-view-mode}
In order to leave the \texttt{command} mode and to go back to the \texttt{view}
mode, not only pressing the escape key will have the intended effect but also
the following commands.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{:cancel}
\item \texttt{:view}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Leaving the Editor}
\label{sec:leaving-the-editor}
These commands can be used to leave the current session.  Exiting a session will
not only terminate the process but also save and reformat the current file, if
available.

The supported commands are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{:exit}
\item \texttt{:leave}
\item \texttt{:quit}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Leaving the Editor without Saving}
\label{sec:leaving-the-editor-without-saving}
Sometimes, the changes made to a file shall not be kept.  Therefore, these
commands might come in handy.  Neither will the changes be saved nor the file be
reformatted, if available at all.

The supported commands are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{:exit unchanged}
\item \texttt{:leave unchanged}
\item \texttt{:quit unchanged}
\end{itemize}
