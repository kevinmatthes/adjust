\section{Installing and Updating the Editor}
\label{sec:installing-and-updating}
It is recommended to install \adjust\ from source using the V CLI with the
following command.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Installing \adjust\ from source, language = bash]
v install --git https://github.com/kevinmatthes/adjust
\end{lstlisting}

Once installed, \adjust\ can be updated using either the above command or
its built-in self-update mechanism which is technically just a wrapper around
the above instruction to the V CLI.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Updating \adjust, language = bash]
adjust --nightly
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Working with the Editor}
\label{sec:working}
\subsection{Starting the Editor}
\label{sec:working:starting}
As soon as the editor is installed, users can begin to edit their files with
\adjust.  To do so, the editor must be called with the paths to the files to
edit during the session.  Files which do not exist, yet, are going to be created
on save.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Starting \adjust, language = bash]
adjust a.v b.c c.nim d.tex e.asy
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Leaving the Editor}
\label{sec:working:leaving}
To leave the current session, users will need to change to the command mode and
execute one of the following commands.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{:exit}
\item \texttt{:exit unchanged}
\item \texttt{:leave}
\item \texttt{:leave unchanged}
\item \texttt{:quit}
\item \texttt{:quit unchanged}
\end{itemize}

All commands are synonymous regarding their final effect:  quitting the current
editing session.  The commands ending in \texttt{unchanged} will cause \adjust \
to discard all changes while those \emph{not} ending in \texttt{unchanged} will
automatically save all changes before leaving.
