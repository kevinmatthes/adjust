## Acknowledgments

- [fox0430/moe][moe], especially its non-Vim commands, inspired the general
  design of `adjust`.
- [github-linguist/linguist][linguist] defines a mapping of coding languages to
  colours which is used to render the "Languages" statistics for each GitHub
  repository, making it a well-known convention also applied to the design of
  `adjust`'s status bar.
